Considered a â€œlandmark work of contemporary classical music",[16] Max Richter's
 solo debut Memoryhouse, an experimental album of "documentary music" recorded
 with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra, explores real and imaginary stories and
 histories.[17] Several of the tracks, such as "Sarajevo", "November", "Arbenita",
  and "Last Days", deal with the aftermath of the Kosovo conflict, while others
  are of childhood memories e.g. "Laika's Journey". The music combines ambient
  sounds, voices (including that of John Cage), and poetry readings from the work
  of Marina Tsvetaeva. BBC Music described the album as "a masterpiece in
  neoclassical composition."[18] Memoryhouse was first played live by Richter a
t the Barbican Centre on 24 January 2014 to coincide with a vinyl re-release
of the album.
